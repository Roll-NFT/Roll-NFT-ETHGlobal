# Technologies and hackathon partners used

Every hosted (created) Roll will be unique ERC721 smart contract - representing NFT entry (ticket) collection for that particular raffle.
We consider to deploy smart contract on Polygon network.
To handle network listening we consider to use TheGraph or Covalent.
We like what Worldcoin offer for web3 developers, and we have ideas on how to implement it.
