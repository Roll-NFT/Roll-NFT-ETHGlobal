# Roll NFT project submission for ETH Global hackathon

https://ethglobal.com/showcase/roll-nft-duj70

Roll NFT is an application that let users to create Rolls (raffles) with any NFT asset they own. And from other side it allows users to participate in existing Rolls to compete for prize pool.

Prize pool could be formed by any kind of NFT, whether it's an Avatar, Game asset, Digital art or Real world asset.

Active Rolls are available on dashboard and could be filtered by NFT collections and/or categories. On profile page available list of current, upcoming and past user Rolls. As well as watch lists of favourite collections and hosts.

For MVP we will cover next user stories:
As a host I can create a Roll (raffle) with any of my NFT assets as a prize
As a user I can see ongoing Rolls on application dashboard
As a user I can participate (mint token) to any ongoing Rolls available on dashboard
As a host I want to claim my revenue from entries sold
As an owner of winning ticket I want to claim my NFT prize
As a Roll owner I want to withdraw prize asset, if Roll was unsuccessful
As a Participant I want to refund participation token asset, if Roll was unsuccessful

# How It's Made - Technologies and hackathon partners we used

On Roll creation main contract (CoreRollNFT.sol) mint a ERC721 token (RollOwnershipToken.sol) and deploy ERC721 contract (RollParticipationToken.sol) which represents NFT collection of tickets.
Chainlink VRF used for RNG and Winning token ID selection.

We also built a variant of that NFT Faucet with NFTPort, that is helpful to mint free NFT token to use as a Prize asset on Roll creation. NFT metadata uploaded to IPFS.

Contracts are deployed on Polygon Mumbai network using hardhat, Quicknode and in some cases Remix.
Quicknode also used as RPC.

Through Covalent API we are fetching ERC20 balances, NFTs and it's metadata from the user's wallet.

Valist solution helped us to deploy a a decentralised version of our frontend. Which is hosted on IPFS.

And we used ENS rollnft.eth domain name to attach our front-end as domain content.

We used Front-end marketplace template, since it implements similar functionality.
